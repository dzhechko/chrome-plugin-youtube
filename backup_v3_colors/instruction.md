Implementation Details
Activation on YouTube Video Pages:
The content script (content.js) is injected into pages matching *://www.youtube.com/watch*.
Extracting Video Information:
The extension extracts the video title, description, and transcript (if available).
If a transcript is available, it is fetched by programmatically clicking the "Open transcript" button and retrieving the transcript text.
Summarization Process:
The extracted text is sent to the background script (background.js) via chrome.runtime.sendMessage.
The background script communicates with an external summarization API to generate a concise summary.
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with a valid API key from your chosen summarization service.
Displaying the Summary:
Once the summary is obtained, it is sent back to the content script, which inserts the summary into the YouTube page below the video description.
Additionally, the popup (popup.html and popup.js) allows users to manually trigger the summarization and view the summary within the popup window.
Error Handling:
The extension includes basic error handling for failed API requests.
Ensure that the selectors used to extract elements from the YouTube page are robust and account for potential changes in YouTube's HTML structure.
Manifest V3 Compliance:
The extension uses Manifest V3, utilizing service workers (background.js) and adhering to the updated permissions and architecture.
Icons:
Provide appropriate icon images in the icons folder for icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png.
